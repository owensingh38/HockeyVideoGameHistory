<p>In this webpage, we will explore the history of hockey video games, from before the eighties to now!  his website is to bring readers in-depth of the history of hockey video gamses, and how the gameplay, graphics, and overall mechanics have evolved.

<h3>Pre-EA:1979 to 1991</h3>

<p>Hockey games started with <i>Hockey!/Soccer!</i> on the Magnavox Odyssey.  It was only pong, but allowed for covers to make it look like either hockey or soccer.  Many other arcade and home console hockey video games came out during this time, the most popular being <i>Hat Trick</i> (1980), <i>Blades of Steel</i> (1980), and <i>Ice Hockey</i> (1985) on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).  All games in this era are:</p>

<h3>NHL Hockey(1991, Sega Genesis)</h3>

<img src="images/nhlhockey.png" title="NHL Hockey" height="307" width="220" />

<p>After EA's sucess with the <i>Madden</i> series, EA started a new video game series in 1991, the <i>NHL</i> series.  It starts with this title.  Simplistic gameplay with real NHL teams, however no actual players, as EA Sports had not obtained the licence from the NHLPA(NHL Players' Association).  Inlcuded was fighting, which would become a problem the very next year.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHLPA '93 (1992, Sega Genesis, SNES)</h3>

<img src="images/nhlpa93.jfif" title="NHLPA '93" height="301" width="220" />

<p>EA's second title includes a subtle change to the title and a noticable missing feature from the game.  There are no real NHL teams in the game.  The NHL had not wanted fighting(or blood) to appear in the game.  But by the time the EA team was notified of this, fighting was in the game.  Not only was fighting in the game, players' heads would blead when injured.  The NHL was firm on their word, as they denied the licence from EA Sports.  This game would feature only NHL players, which is a first.  The conflict would be resolved, but at a cost, depending how you feel about it.  The famous clip from the movie "Swingers" shows the blood in action.  Give it a watch!</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL '94 (1993, Sega Genesis, SNES, Sega CD)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl94.jpg" title="NHL94" height="313" width="220" />

<p>This is often considered the best sports video game of all time.  Released in 1993, the game now has both NHL teams an players, the ultimate expirence.  However, fighting had to be removed in exchange for the NHL teams.  One timers, which is when a player shoots the puck as soon as it's passed to him/her, were also introduced, which made it way easier to score as well.  Jeremy Roenick, a nine-time NHL All-Star, is often considered the best player in the game, number 23 for the Chicago Blackhawks.  The game also had a Sega CD version, with real-life crowd sounds and more advanced audio.</p>



<h3>NHL Hockey(1993, DOS)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl94dos.jfif" title="NHL94DOS" height="262" width="200" />

<p>The very first NHL game on PC(every NHL game had a PC release until 2009).  Its gameplay was nearly identical to NHL 94 on the Genesis and SNES, but the graphics and audio were slightly improved.  Jerseys and players also look more realistic, along with the anthems and PA announcer.  </p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL '95(1994, Sega Genesis, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Game Gear(Known as NHL Hockey), Plug and Play, DOS(NHL Hockey '95)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl95.jfif" title="NHL95" height="275" width="200" />

<p>After NHL 94's sucess, the graphics change their look for the first time.  The ice is a much lighter blue, and player sprites have a new, chubbier look.  The gameplay is slightly faster as well.  This is the first NHL game to allow the player to change the rosters and create a player, which are still popular today.  While NHL 96 is credited with being the first game to be able to play a full season, NHL 95 is actually the first.  Meanwhile, NHL 95 on the Game Boy is often considered to be one of the worst hockey video games of all-time.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 96(1995, Sega Genesis, SNES, PC, Game Boy</h3>

<img src="images/nhl96.png" title="NHL96" height="307" width="220" />

<p>NHL 96 changed the player sprites and graphics(again), this time less bright and skinnier player sprites.  This is often creidted to being the first game to play a full season, although it is not(NHL 95 was the first).  The gameplay was also sped up.  The game doesn't have much otherwise.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 97(1996, Sega Genesis, Playstation, SNES, Sega Saturn, PC)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl97.png" title="NHL97" height="303" width="220" />

<p>NHL 97 is the first EA NHL title on a 3D console(Playstation and Sega Saturn), and just the fifth ice hockey game on the Playstation or Saturn(First four were 2 ON 2 Open Ice Challange, NHL Faceoff, NHL All-Star Hockey, and NHL Powerplay '96).  Little change for the Genesis and SNES versions.  This is also the first game with National teams, although it is only Canada, the United States, and Russia.  Goalies also have their custom-painted masks, along with Hockey Night In Canada announcer Jim Hughson(Playstation and Sega Saturn editions only). This starts the tradition of having only one player, or the <i>Cover Athlete</i>, with Florida Panthers goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 98(1997, Sega Genesis, Playstation, SNES, Sega Saturn, PC)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl98.png" title="NHL98" height="256" width="256" />

<p>NHL 98 appears on every console it did the previous year.  And, there is little change this year.  More national teams also appear in this one, such as Sweeden, Finland, Czech Republic, etc.  It is also the last NHL game on the Genesis and SNES.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 99(1998, PC, Playstation, N64)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl99.png" title="NHL99" height="254" width="220" />

<p>NHL 99 released on the fewest amount of consoles since NHL '94, with only three consoles hosting the game.  The game is released on the Nintendo 64 for the first time.  The games are identical on all consoles, which will become a theme within the upcoming years.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2000(1999, PC, Playstation, and Game Boy Color)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2000.png" title="NHL2000" height="251" width="220" />

<p>The start of a new century... introduces little.  Both versions are similar menu wise, and the exact gameplay wise.  However, the Atlanta Thrashers(Known now as the Winnipeg Jets) were introduced into the game, giving the game 28 teams.  This is also the first game to have an International tournament mode, and enhanced playablility on Playstation.  Bill Clement also joins Jim Hughson for play-by-play.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2001(2000, PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2001.jfif" title="NHL2001" height="248" width="203" />

<p>The series now appears on the Playstation 2, with updated graphics and enchanced and new gameplay.  Latvia and Ukraine were added to the PC and PS2 versions, and the European league Elitserien was added as a add-on in March.  Other than that, nothing new here.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2002(2001, PC, PS2, Xbox, GBA)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2002.png" title="NHL2002" height="312" width="220" />

<p>NHL 2002 is the first game of the series to be released on the new Microsoft console, the Xbox.  It is also the one and only NHL game on the Game Boy Advance(unreleased in Europe).  The GBA version plays similar to NHL 96 on the SNES, with the addition of the new teams Thrashers, Hurricanes, Predators, Avalanhce, Wild, and Blue Jackets.  Bill Clement is changed to Dan Taylor in the other three versions as well.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2003(2002, PC, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2003.jpg" title="NHL2003"/>

<p>The first NHL game on the GameCube, little is changed with the exception of newly introduced GameBreaker.  Once the player performs enough dekes, it is used to change the momentum of the game.  Examples include scoring, a big fit, or winning a big fight.  Otherwise, little change in this title.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2004(2003, PC, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2004.png" title="NHL2004"/>

<p>NHL 2004 is often regarded as one of the best NHL games of all time.  The gameplay was improved drastically, as skating was faster, puck control was improved, checking was improved, as so on.  The game also introduces the full-on Stanley Cup celebration.  One of the most popular modes, Franchise mode, was revamped as <i>Dynasty</i> mode.  Along with this is three new leagues from Europe: DEL (Germany), Sweedish Elitserien(Now known as the SHL), and the SM-liiga (Finland).</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 2005(2004, PC, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl2005.png" title="NHL2005"/>

<p>NHL 2005 adds the ability to control players without the puck (when your team has the puck), but only with certain settings.  The IIHF also gave EA the licence for this year, allowing a new World Cup mode.  Unfortunetly, on PC, the game was very limited and even had no Create-a-player.  This foreshadows the fate of the NHL series on PC.  This is the game were the mode Free4All is introduced.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 06(2005, PC, PS2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl06.png" title="NHL06"/>

<p>NHL 06 adds back Create-A-Player, along with a new mode.  Remember NHL '94?  It returns as a mode in the PS2 version.  You can play NHL 94 with updated colors and rosters, although there are no player names.  Otherwise, no change here.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 07(2006, PC, PS2, Xbox, PSP, Xbox 360)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl07.jpg" title="NHL07" />

<p>NHL 07 is one of the most revolutionary NHL games.  While the PS2 and Xbox are the same, the Xbox 360 version introduces the Skill Stick controls.  Now, you can control the hockey stick with the right stick of the controller.  This allows for a larger quantity and more precise deking.  NHL 07 is also the only NHL game on the Plastation Portable, although its gameplay is the exact same as the Xbox and Playstation 2 versions.  The PS3 would get a NHL game the next year.  The Czech League Tipsport Extraliga was added, along with a new physics system for the Xbox 360.  Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson are replaced with Gary Thorn and Bill Clement for commentary.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 08(2007, PC, PS2, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl08.png" title="NHL08"/>

<p>NHL 08 is the first NHL game on the Playstation 3, since the PS3 came after NHL  07's release.  Few new features are added.  You can now play as AHL teams, along with being abke to conrol only the goalie in "Goalie mode."  Players can also create custom plays in Practice mode. </p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 09(2008, PC, PS2, Xbox 360, PS3, DS(Cancelled) Wii(Cancelled))</h3>

<img src="images/nhl09.png" title="NHL09"/>

<p>For the X360 and PS3 versions, EASHL is a new mode(which is still popular today).  You can create a player and play online 6v6.  The graphics alsp get a slightly different look.  This is the last game on the PS2 and PC.  Fans still yearn for a NHL PC game to this day.  The DS and Wii were expected to have a version of NHL 09, but both versions were canceled.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 10(2009, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl10.jpg" title="NHL10"/>

<p>The game intorduces many small new feautres.  Players can now shield the puck along the boards, enchanced fore-checking, make checks and fights after the whistle, fight in first person, and score from the knees.  Goalies are more intelligent, along with a more interactive crowd.  Dynasty mode is renamed, "Be a GM."  Battle for the Cup allows the users to play a Stanley Cup finals series without playing a season, with any team.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 11(2010, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl11.jpg" title="NHL11" />

<p>The game has a physics-based engine, which makes the game feel more authentic from the animation-based gameplay style.  Broken Sticks were added, along with being able to kick the puck (without a stick).  Players can postition the stick, tie up the opponent, allowed the user to shoot off the faceoff, and deke off the draw.  The most popular mode, to this day, was added in this game.  Hockey Ultimate Team(HUT) was added, which is a mode where you collect cards and play games using the player cards.  This game is the last to feature the Atlanta Thrashers, who would become the Winnipeg Jets the next year.</p>

<h3>NHL Slapshot(2010, Nintendo Wii)</h3>

<img src="images/nhlslapshot1.jpg" title="NHLSlapshot1" />
<img src="images/nhlslapshot2.jpg" title="NHLSlapshot2" />

<p>A Wii exculsive, the game features limited modes, but you can play Be a Pro starting in Peewee(called Peewee to Pro).  A stick that could be used with the Wiimote was also included in many copies of the game.  The gameplay is extremely arcade like.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 12(2011, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl12.png" title="NHL12" />

<p>In this title, players can collide with goalies, along with goalie vs player fights.  Be a Pro and Be a Legend are revamped as well.  Players can also play in the <i>Winter Classic</i>, an annual outdoor game in the NHL.  The physics engine was also revamped.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 13(2012, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl13.png" title="NHL13" />

<p>NHL 13 introduces the <i>True Performance Skating Engine</i>, which massively enchanced skating.  The game had the best first week sales in EA NHL history.  Along with the new skating, the AI was massively improved as well.  Team presenatations are closer to real live.  GM connected is Be a GM but you can play with people online.  NHL Moments Live allowed the player to re-create moments in NHL history.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 14(2013, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl14.jpg" title="NHL14" />

<p>NHL 14 introduces much better fighting and collision engines, which makes the game more satisfying to play.  Be-a-pro has been revamped, now called Live the Life, which players can make off-ice decisions.  NHL 94 anniversary mode isn't the real NHL '94, but is an arcade style mode with NHL '94 presentation.  This is my personal favorite on this list.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 15(2014, Xbox One, PS4, Xbox 360, PS3)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl15.png" title="NHL15" />

<p>Often regared as one of the worst games, the PS4 and Xbox versions remove most of the game modes fans loves, such as GM connected.  EASHL was even removed as well.  Enchaned graphics seem to be the only benefit for the new-gen games.  The 360 and PS3 editions are the same.  Mike Emerick and Eddie Olyck replace Thorn and Clement.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 16(2015, Xbox One, PS4, Xbox 360, PS3(NHL Legacy Edition on both PS3 and Xbox 360)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl16.jpg" title="NHL16" />

<p>NHL 16 brings back EASHL, but other than that, little has changed.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 17(2016, Xbox One, PS4)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl17.jpg" title="NHL17" />

<p>The World Cup of Hockey happened before the season, so it was added as a mode in NHL 17.  More realistic camera angles are added as well.  Be-a-GM is know Franchise Mode, allowing the user to be both the GM and the owner.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 18(2017, Xbox One, PS4)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl18.jpg" title="NHL18" />

<p>NHL 18 adds a new arcade, 3 on 3 mode called NHL Threes. You could play as an NHL team or one of the NHL mascot teams.  While this initally seemed like a great addition, the fans got bored of it quickly.  The new Adidas jerseys were also added to the game.  NHL 18 is also regarded as one of the worst in the series as well.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 19(2018, Xbox One, PS4)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl19.jpg" title="NHL19" />

<p>NHL 19 introduces the most authentic skating to date, with the <i>Real Player Motion Technology</i>.  The engine is based off of Edmonton Oilers forward Connor McDavid.  The hitting engine was changed and made hits more fluid and satisfying, based off of Nashville Predators defensemen P.K. Subban.  World of CHEL is a new mode, where you can play NHL Ones, an outdoor setting where everyone is for themselves.  NHL threes can be played, along with EASHL.  The mode is similar to NBA 2K's <i>The Park</i>.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 20(2019, Xbox One, PS4)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl20.jpg" title="NHL20" />

<p>NHL 20 changed up the World of Chel mode, adding Ones Eliminator and Thress Eliminator, battle  royale like versions of Ones and Three modes.  Little was added gameplay wise to the 2020 installment of the series.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NHL 21(2020, Xbox One, PS4)</h3>

<img src="images/nhl21.jpg" title="NHL21" />

<p>NHL 21 did alot to revamp the game.  Be A Pro was overhauled into a much more interactive mode, being akin to NHL 14's "Live The Life".  Franchise Mode was slightly modified as well.  Several new dekes were added, such as the Michigan/Lacrosse/Svechnikov goal, chip dekes off the boards or in open ice, and the Nikita Kucherov "no move" deke.  Goalies were also improved, making two-on-ones not become instant goals.</p>
